WARNING: [DRC LUTLP-2] Combinatorial Loop Allowed: 1 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_1_i/top_0/inst/S_TREADY_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/top_0/inst/S_TREADY_reg_i_1/O, cell design_1_i/top_0/inst/S_TREADY_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
